<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BOAXrY6G7xA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Every company wants to be first to market, but that’s only one part of a product’s success. Companies often consider accessibility too time-consuming or difficult to put into place without remembering that meeting customer needs is what keeps them in the market. This talk will cover my experience advocating for accessibility as a disabled developer and why there’s no excuse for treating it as an edge case. We&rsquo;ll also walk through some technical examples and have a little time for small discussion at the end.</p>

<p>Ashlee is a Software Engineer at Sigstr who spends a lot of time with web accessibility. She has been hard-of-hearing since birth and has worn hearing aids for several years. She shares her experiences as a disabled developer through public speaking and blog writing with the hope that educating others will lead to a more accessible world. If she&rsquo;s not at her computer, she&rsquo;s probably working on one of her (many) knitting projects, walking her dogs, or re-watching Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy yet again.</p>

<p>Adam discusses the ethical questions of developing a habit-forming product. We will look at the “Hook” model that is used to create a habit-forming product: Trigger, Action, Variable Reward, and Investment. Finally, we will look at the “Make It Rain” iOS app as a case study of the lessons learned from this book.</p>

<p>David Michael Gregg introduces Meilir Page-Jones&#8217; software design principle of &ldquo;connascence&rdquo; - Popularized formerly by Jim Weirich.</p>

<p>Learning how to write quality, maintainable code has been a question left to intuition, personal reinvention (after repeated failure), and the memorization of maxims such as &ldquo;Tell Don&rsquo;t Ask&rdquo;, &ldquo;Feature Envy&rdquo;, SOLID, et al.</p>

<p>But can we compare these maxims – these learned lessons – across paradigms, and arrive at a generalization which serves as a sort of guiding &ldquo;Grand Unified Theory of Software Development&rdquo; (Jim Weirich)?</p>

<p>Some of this work has been done, and the resulting concept and vocabulary is not only simple to explain (and immediately applicable) to early learners, but can serve as a metric for quantifying maintainability and refactoring opportunities at all levels of software architecture.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XkGFMTyUr5A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Tony gave us an early preview of his talk at RubyConf 2018. The video wasn&rsquo;t great, so just watch the final product from RubyConf!</p>

<p>To many Rubyists just starting out, gems can appear very mysterious. You list them in a Gemfile and run &lsquo;bundle install&rsquo; or install them directly with &lsquo;gem install&rsquo;. Suddenly, your programs gain more functionality than they had before. But what are gems? What makes them work? How can you make your own to share with the world? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>

<p>Tony is a senior developer with about 10 years of professional development experience (8 of those with Ruby). He enjoys working in development teams of all sizes and helping junior developers level up. When he&rsquo;s not hacking away or being a part-time DevOp, you can find him online kicking butt in Mario Kart.</p>

<p>We Rubyists tend to include lots of open-source gems in our projects. How do we responsibly use them and keep our production apps from breaking? In this quick Ruby Jam, Steve covers how he tests to make using gems safer and upgrading them cleaner, and how gem authors can help.</p>

<p>Steve has been writing Ruby since 2011, and writes (and relies on) tests daily. He&rsquo;s written web applications for money since the dark days of PHP 3.x. He enjoys solving problems, improving craftsmanship, mentoring, and tacos.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CbPTb_4bVQw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Ruby Jam by Chris Flack:</p>

<p>With some inspiration from Stephen’s params talk last month, Chris talks little about some useful tricks and dangerous pitfalls I’ve learned from working with Rails&#8217; Strong Parameters protections.</p>

<p>Chris is an Associate Software Developer at MOBI. He started in tech working as a Genius for Apple, and he still has a big head about that title. He wandered around for a few years as an IT generalist before attending The Iron Yard and starting a career in coding.</p>

<p>Away from work, he&rsquo;s an avid reader, home-brewer, and gamer. He has a degree from Ball State in religious studies and counseling psychology. And he thinks all of that is a lot more relevant to software development than it might sound.</p>

<p>Active Record makes interfacing with the database in a Rails app easy and clean, but it can cause headaches when working with a lot of data. I will walk through how to effectively use Rails to Create, Read, Update, and Destroy Mb or Gb of data, as well as what might be causing the headaches in the first place.</p>

<p>Stephen Freund is a data engineer at Springbuk. His primary focus for the last ~1 year has been normalizing and importing healthcare data for use in the Springbuk app. Besides writing Ruby, he enjoys running, reading, watching football, and debating the merits of Star Wars vs Star Trek.</p>

<p>The developer hiring process is vulnerable. Let’s attack it!</p>

<p>We’ll draw on the pen testers toolkit and lessons learned the hard way across my decade of startup hiring. We&rsquo;ll break down the typical developer interview process. Then, we&rsquo;ll use the lens of social engineering and cognitive bias to identify specific tactics for acing interviews. Finally, we’ll defend our interviews to make them better at predicting team success.</p>

<p>Attendees will leave armed with both a) tools to be a more effective interviewer and b) tools to presents their best self as a candidate.</p>

<p>Wes spent the last 10 years responsible for engineering at an Indianapolis SaaS startup called PolicyStat. Through building that product team from scratch, he learned (the hard way) a lot about hiring. He discovered that&rsquo;s it is deceptively difficult. After selling PolicyStat last year, Wes started a SaaS company called Woven to fix developer hiring.</p>

<p>There may come a time when rbenv, rvm, or cruby won&rsquo;t cut it for your use case. Sometimes you need or want a current-day Ruby version installed on the system level but most Linux distros provide really out of date Rubies. To get what you want, you need to roll your own Ruby. Creating OS packages may sound scary, but in reality they are easy once you have a build system setup. I currently maintain a small set of servers for my side projects and have used my own self-built package of Ruby for quite a while now.</p>

<p>Who is Tony Drake?
Tony is a senior web developer with about 10 years (most of it in Ruby) of total experience building websites professionally. By day, he curses DHH&rsquo;s name while hacking away at code and trying to keep junior devs from scraping their knees. By night, he&rsquo;s peeling away from the starting line while blowing up other vehicles in my way in Mario Kart.</p>

<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/soulcutter">Bradley Schaefer</a> - Metaprogramming with <code>super</code> powers</h3>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ukfAgLKnYZM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Metaprogramming in Ruby gets a bad rap, yet Rails itself is chock-full of metaprogramming. So what is it that separates good metaprogramming from bad?</p>

<p>Here we will take a look at some of the problems people encounter when they attempt to wield it themselves, and approaches that can make your own metaprogramming code feel as magical as it feels in Rails.</p>

<p>Bradley has lived in six different states but has finally settled into Cleveland, Ohio as his base of operations. He&rsquo;s a lead engineer working remotely for Stitch Fix in San Francisco and will probably talk your ear off about the benefits of the remote life if you give him a chance. He&rsquo;s been a contributor to RSpec on the RSpec core team and wishes he had more time to spend on OSS. You can connect with him on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/soulcutter">@soulcutter</a></p>
