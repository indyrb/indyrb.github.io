Active Record makes interfacing with the database in a Rails app easy and clean, but it can cause headaches when working with a lot of data. I will walk through how to effectively use Rails to Create, Read, Update, and Destroy Mb or Gb of data, as well as what might be causing the headaches in the first place.

Stephen Freund is a data engineer at Springbuk. His primary focus for the last ~1 year has been normalizing and importing healthcare data for use in the Springbuk app. Besides writing Ruby, he enjoys running, reading, watching football, and debating the merits of Star Wars vs Star Trek.
