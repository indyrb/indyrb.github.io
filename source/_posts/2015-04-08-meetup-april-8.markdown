##Hack an API

We split into small groups and each built a simple notes API using any Ruby library we want. After an hour or so, we reconvened to discuss the decisions made and their repercussions.

Some of the apps built:

* [Rails Notes (Rails-API)](https://github.com/ar3/rails_notes)
* [Voltron (Volt.rb)](https://github.com/unixmonkey/voltron)
