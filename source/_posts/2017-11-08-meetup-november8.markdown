When faced with a data science problem, most people reach for Python or R but there is a growing ecosystem of data science tools for Ruby. Daniel briefly discusses what data science is, how it is similar and different from software engineering, and gives an introduction to some of the tools available to Rubyists.


Daniel Carpenter is a software engineer and data scientist with special interest in health technology. He works for Omada Health, a San Francisco based digital health company offering online health coaching for pre-diabetes. He's been a software engineer for about 8 years and Rubyist for about 6 years.
