###[David Baldwin](https://twitter.com/baldwindavid), [Andrew L Robinson III](https://twitter.com/ar3_me), [Miles Sterrett](https://twitter.com/mileszs) - Unconventional Rails Objects

We discuss some of the objects written into Rails applications we work with that are not common in Rails. We talk a bit about our thoughts on them, and lead a discussion for the whole group.
