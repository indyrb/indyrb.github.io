Ruby Jam by Chris Flack:

With some inspiration from Stephen’s params talk last month, Chris talks little about some useful tricks and dangerous pitfalls I’ve learned from working with Rails' Strong Parameters protections.

Chris is an Associate Software Developer at MOBI. He started in tech working as a Genius for Apple, and he still has a big head about that title. He wandered around for a few years as an IT generalist before attending The Iron Yard and starting a career in coding.

Away from work, he's an avid reader, home-brewer, and gamer. He has a degree from Ball State in religious studies and counseling psychology. And he thinks all of that is a lot more relevant to software development than it might sound.
