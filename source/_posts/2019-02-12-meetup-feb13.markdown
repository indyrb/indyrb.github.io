Miles shows off how he approaches benchmarking a slow API endpoint of a Rails application, and demonstrates usage of Apache Bench & RubyProf, and how to interpret their results.

Building applications for the Web has long been a passion for Miles, though cultivating communities has become a new passion.

Miles organizes the Indianapolis Ruby Brigade, founded Indy Hackers, and, once in a while, helps with the Indianapolis Javascript Society. He finds people to be even more interesting than the code he spends hours upon hours writing. That said, youâ€™ll still find him glued to his guitar once in a while.
