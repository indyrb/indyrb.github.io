<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X-m2zO6epiE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>The developer hiring process is vulnerable. Let’s attack it!</p>

<p>We’ll draw on the pen testers toolkit and lessons learned the hard way across my decade of startup hiring. We&rsquo;ll break down the typical developer interview process. Then, we&rsquo;ll use the lens of social engineering and cognitive bias to identify specific tactics for acing interviews. Finally, we’ll defend our interviews to make them better at predicting team success.</p>

<p>Attendees will leave armed with both a) tools to be a more effective interviewer and b) tools to presents their best self as a candidate.</p>

<p>Wes spent the last 10 years responsible for engineering at an Indianapolis SaaS startup called PolicyStat. Through building that product team from scratch, he learned (the hard way) a lot about hiring. He discovered that&rsquo;s it is deceptively difficult. After selling PolicyStat last year, Wes started a SaaS company called Woven to fix developer hiring.</p>

<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/t27duck">Tony Drake</a> - Rolling your own Ruby package</h3>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kPUzLZN6Zx8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>There may come a time when rbenv, rvm, or cruby won&rsquo;t cut it for your use case. Sometimes you need or want a current-day Ruby version installed on the system level but most Linux distros provide really out of date Rubies. To get what you want, you need to roll your own Ruby. Creating OS packages may sound scary, but in reality they are easy once you have a build system setup. I currently maintain a small set of servers for my side projects and have used my own self-built package of Ruby for quite a while now.</p>

<p>Who is Tony Drake?
Tony is a senior web developer with about 10 years (most of it in Ruby) of total experience building websites professionally. By day, he curses DHH&rsquo;s name while hacking away at code and trying to keep junior devs from scraping their knees. By night, he&rsquo;s peeling away from the starting line while blowing up other vehicles in my way in Mario Kart.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7H6AiL7Hi7I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>So you built a gem that integrates with ActiveRecord. You write tests, push to Github, CI passes, and then publish to RubyGems. Great! But later, someone submits a bug&hellip; the gem doesn&rsquo;t work with MySQL and Rails 4.2 and you only tested your gem against PostgreSQL and Rails 5. You want your gem to support all &ldquo;active&rdquo; versions of Rails and at least both PostgreSQL and MySQL. So how to do you it? How do you get your tests to be able to run against different versions of Rails and databases on a whim? Let&rsquo;s go through from start to finish the story of creating a gem and testing against these permutations of real world setups.</p>

<p>Tony Drake is a senior web developer with about 10 years (most of it in Ruby) of total experience building sites professionally. By day, He curses DHH&rsquo;s name while hacking away at code. By night, he&rsquo;s peeling away from the starting line while blowing up other vehicles in my way in Mario Kart.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/owXhe4mKqwc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Ruby’s a scripting language, so why not use it for, you know, scripting. When you combine MacOS’s built-in scripting and automation tools - such as Automator, launchd, AppleScript, Workflows and Services - with Ruby, nothing is out of reach. Let’s walk through MacOS’ core automation and scripting tools, and use a dash of Ruby to build ourselves something useful (or, failing that, something silly).</p>

<p>Chris has been developing in Ruby for more than a decade, is a former instructor at The Iron Yard coding bootcamp, and current Senior Engineer at Sigtsr. He cares entirely too much about college football, naps, and podcasts.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L1E8cKWCEtU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>This talk is over a brief journey through the world of Relational Online Analytical Processing (ROLAP) and seeing how this can apply to Rails. This will also include a couple database considerations and possibly an overview of a DSL he&rsquo;s building that ties it all together.</p>

<p>Tony Drake is currently senior developer on a team specializing in billing and reporting for an enterprise-level Rails application where he co-architected a custom ROLAP framework using PostgreSQL on the backend. He&rsquo;d like to share his ten years (seven of those with Rails) of professional web development experience with others.  He can also kick anyone&rsquo;s butt in Mario Kart with Rosalina.</p>

<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/rydertimberlake">Ryder Timberlake</a> - Expand Your Perspective and Change Your Life Through Pair Programming</h3>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LEHqhp1-zNQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p><em><em>Editor&rsquo;s Note:</em> This video is highly condensed for time and has poor audio due to many people speaking simultaneously. That said, I think it&rsquo;s a wonderful example of how to run an impromptu meetup workshop, and a view into the thought and processes of solving a few simple puzzles on Codewars.</em></p>

<p>Tech is siloed. Languages, teams, and services are siloed. Good design is frequently portrayed and interpreted as a constellation of context-independent best practices. And oftentimes we can hardly have a productive conversation about design without our knee-jerk ideas of the way we ought to build something getting in the way.<br/>
When we enforce conventions in a project, we often do so without a good understanding of which conventions are essential and which are peripheral. We often do so without a sufficiently shared vocabulary of design with which to argue constructively. And when we choose a tool, we often do so by merely defaulting to what we know behind a shield of inscrutable buzzwords &ndash; words whose meaning is rarely exposed to the same rigorous inquiry with which we examine spaces or tabs or choice of editor.</p>

<p>I would argue that a startling majority of the most intractable technical problems we face in software are simply interpersonal and communication problems expressing themselves in a technical domain. And I think we can make things a whole lot better by just putting our heads together.</p>

<p>This is more workshop than talk. Bring your laptop and ideally your free <a href="https://www.codewars.com">Codewars account</a>.</p>

<p>Ryder is an Iron Yard alumnus and engineer at Salesforce, where he writes tests for the Approvals app and is a contributor to the automated testing framework used across the Marketing Cloud. He is an outspoken advocate of sound implementations of pair programming, which he believes to holistically aid all manner of technical and human endeavors in software &ndash; from writing maintainable code and fostering good user experiences to encouraging effective communication and diversity in the workplace.</p>
