<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZxU0lpjj7fs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>The ruby shell is something many of us use but rarely think about. In this talk, I will be digging in to the ruby shell to find out how it works and how we could build our own.</p>

<p>Steven is a software engineer at Springbuk. He writes flawless backend Ruby, pristine frontend React, and has <em>never</em> pushed a bug to production.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mElNXIjLdDw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Join Nic for a talk about web accessibility. How easy it is to implement, why it matters, and how you can increase your user base without internationalizing your product. This talk will focus primarily on vision-based disabilities and the options to make your sites/apps delightful for them.</p>

<p>While Nic&rsquo;s official title is &ldquo;iOS Engineer who also contributes to the web team&rdquo; he typically just goes by &ldquo;Software Engineer&rdquo;. As a remote employee of Big Nerd Ranch, Nic is currently focusing on accessibility issues on a project at a Fortune 500 company and studying computer vision.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CbPTb_4bVQw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Ruby Jam by Chris Flack:</p>

<p>With some inspiration from Stephen’s params talk last month, Chris talks little about some useful tricks and dangerous pitfalls I’ve learned from working with Rails&#8217; Strong Parameters protections.</p>

<p>Chris is an Associate Software Developer at MOBI. He started in tech working as a Genius for Apple, and he still has a big head about that title. He wandered around for a few years as an IT generalist before attending The Iron Yard and starting a career in coding.</p>

<p>Away from work, he&rsquo;s an avid reader, home-brewer, and gamer. He has a degree from Ball State in religious studies and counseling psychology. And he thinks all of that is a lot more relevant to software development than it might sound.</p>

<p>Active Record makes interfacing with the database in a Rails app easy and clean, but it can cause headaches when working with a lot of data. I will walk through how to effectively use Rails to Create, Read, Update, and Destroy Mb or Gb of data, as well as what might be causing the headaches in the first place.</p>

<p>Stephen Freund is a data engineer at Springbuk. His primary focus for the last ~1 year has been normalizing and importing healthcare data for use in the Springbuk app. Besides writing Ruby, he enjoys running, reading, watching football, and debating the merits of Star Wars vs Star Trek.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SEwu_BtfUSs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/soulcutter">Bradley Schaefer</a> - Metaprogramming with <code>super</code> powers</h3>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ukfAgLKnYZM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Metaprogramming in Ruby gets a bad rap, yet Rails itself is chock-full of metaprogramming. So what is it that separates good metaprogramming from bad?</p>

<p>Here we will take a look at some of the problems people encounter when they attempt to wield it themselves, and approaches that can make your own metaprogramming code feel as magical as it feels in Rails.</p>

<p>Bradley has lived in six different states but has finally settled into Cleveland, Ohio as his base of operations. He&rsquo;s a lead engineer working remotely for Stitch Fix in San Francisco and will probably talk your ear off about the benefits of the remote life if you give him a chance. He&rsquo;s been a contributor to RSpec on the RSpec core team and wishes he had more time to spend on OSS. You can connect with him on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/soulcutter">@soulcutter</a></p>
