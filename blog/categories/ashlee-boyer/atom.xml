<p>Every company wants to be first to market, but that’s only one part of a product’s success. Companies often consider accessibility too time-consuming or difficult to put into place without remembering that meeting customer needs is what keeps them in the market. This talk will cover my experience advocating for accessibility as a disabled developer and why there’s no excuse for treating it as an edge case. We&rsquo;ll also walk through some technical examples and have a little time for small discussion at the end.</p>

<p>Ashlee is a Software Engineer at Sigstr who spends a lot of time with web accessibility. She has been hard-of-hearing since birth and has worn hearing aids for several years. She shares her experiences as a disabled developer through public speaking and blog writing with the hope that educating others will lead to a more accessible world. If she&rsquo;s not at her computer, she&rsquo;s probably working on one of her (many) knitting projects, walking her dogs, or re-watching Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy yet again.</p>
