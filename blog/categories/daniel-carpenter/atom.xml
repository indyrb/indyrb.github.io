<p>When faced with a data science problem, most people reach for Python or R but there is a growing ecosystem of data science tools for Ruby. Daniel briefly discusses what data science is, how it is similar and different from software engineering, and gives an introduction to some of the tools available to Rubyists.</p>

He works for Omada Health, a San Francisco based digital health company offering online health coaching for pre-diabetes. He&rsquo;s been a software engineer for about 8 years and Rubyist for about 6 years.</p>

He&rsquo;s the co-founder of Woven, exploring better ways to hire software engineers. He&rsquo;s been fighting modern JavaScript frameworks since Backbone in 2011 and actually started enjoying them in 2014 with React.</p>
